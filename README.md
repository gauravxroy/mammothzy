|  - Web (React.js)           |
|  - Mobile (React Native)    |
+------------+---------------+
             |
+------------v---------------+
|      API Layer (Backend)   |
|  - Node.js / Express.js    |
|  - RESTful APIs            |
+------------+---------------+
             |
+------------v---------------+

```

### Microservices (Optional)

If you are using microservices for scalability, the architecture can include separate services for handling activities, bookings, user management, etc.

## App Flow

Here’s a flowchart for how the user interacts with the platform:

1. **User Login**:
   - Users (HR professionals or team leaders) log in via email and password or third-party OAuth providers.
   
2. **Browse Activities**:
   - Once logged in, users can browse a catalog of team-building activities.
   
3. **Book Activities**:
   - After selecting an activity, users can book it by filling in relevant details like date, number of participants, and location.

4. **Manage Bookings**:
   - Users can view, modify, or cancel existing bookings from their dashboard.

5. **Vendor Management**:
   - Vendors can register, upload activity details, and manage their services.
